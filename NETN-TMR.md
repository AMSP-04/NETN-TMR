## Introduction

In a federated distributed simulation the participating systems (federates) collectively model the synthetic environment. Allocation of modelling responsibilities are based on individual federate capabilities, federation design agreements, and initial scenario conditions. The responsibility of updating an attribute for a specific simulated entity is allocated to at most one federate. However, during execution, the modelling responsibility may change and the ownership of attributes can be transferred. 

Basic services for the divestiture and acquisition of attribute ownership is provided by IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA). A negotiated and coordinated transfer of modelling responsibilities requires agreements between federates before attribute ownership is transferred. 

The NATO Education and Training Network Transfer of Modelling Responsibilities (NETN-TMR) FOM Module is a specification of how to perform a negotiated and coordinated transfer of attribute modelling responsibility between federates in a distributed simulation. 

The specification is based on IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) Object Model Template (OMT) and primarily intended to support interoperability in a federated simulation (federation) based on HLA. A Federation Object Model (FOM) Module is used to specify how data is represented and exchanged in the federation. The NETN-TMR FOM module is available as an XML file for use in HLA based federations.

### Purpose

The NETN-TMR FOM module provides a standard interface and protocol for conducting negotiated and coordinated transfer of attribute modelling responsibility between federates. It extends the HLA Ownership Management services by providing the means to 
1. Negotiate the transfer of ownership. 
2. Initiate ownership transfer using a Trigger federate.

A transfer of modelling responsibility is performed during runtime, to dynamically change the responsibility to update specific attributes, to a more suitable federate.

For example: 
- Transfer from a Live to a Virtual or Constructive simulation
- Transfer between Virtual and Constructive simulations
- Transfer between hi- and low-fidelity models
- Transfer to allow backup, maintenance or load-balancing
- Transfer of certain attributes to functional models such as movement, damage assessment etc.

### Scope

NETN-TMR covers the following cases:

* Negotiated acquisition where a federate request to receive the modelling responsibility 
* Negotiated divestiture where a federate request another federate to take modelling responsibility
* Acquisition without negotiation where a federate receives the modelling responsibility 
* Cancellation of transfer


## Transfer of Modelling Responsibilities Pattern

NETN-TMR uses a combination of HLA interactions and HLA Owenership Management services to negotiate and perform a coordinated transfer of attribute ownership. The pattern includes a triggering interaction (optional) to initiate a transfer, and interactions for requesting, offering, cancelling and sending results of a completed transfer.

### Interaction Classes
<img src="./images/interactionclasses.png" width="700px"/>

**Figure: Interaction Classes**

#### TMR (Root)

The `TMR` interaction class provide a set of basic parameters used in all TMR interactions to uniquely identify and direct TMR transactions between participating federates.

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|TransactionID|The TransactionID is a unique reference to a specific execution of a TMR pattern. It consists of two values, a Counter and a Federate Handle. The Transaction ID is also encoded and used as the User Supplied Tag in the HLA Ownership services to allow a correlation between the TMR interactions and HLA Ownership services. The Transaction ID is generated by a trigger federate or, if no trigger federate is used, directly by the requesting federate. The Transaction ID is then used through the TMR pattern.|
|RequestFederate|A Federate Name specifying the federate that makes the request for the transfer.|
|ResponseFederate|A Federate Name specifying the federate that is the responding federate.|


#### TMR_RequestTransferModellingResponsibility
A `TMR_RequestTransferModellingResponsibility` interaction is sent from the requesting federate to the responding federate. If the request is the result of a `TMR_InitiateTransferModellingResponsibility` interaction, the parameters from that interaction shall be copied and used in the request.

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|TransferType|An enumerated value that indicates the direction of the transfer on the ownership and whether there shall be any negotiation: `Acquire` = Requesting Federate acquires instance attribute ownership from the Responding Federate (current owner), `Divest` = Requesting Federate (current owner) releases instance attribute ownership to Responding Federate and `AcquireWithoutNegotiating` = Requesting Federate acquires unowned instance attributes.|
|Instances| A set of references to NETN entities. Reference is done by using NETN UniqueId (UUID).|
|Attributes|The common set of attributes for all referenced instances to be included in the transfer. Attributes are referenced by attribute name.|
|CapabilityType|Optional. An enumerated value that specifies the capability type that the transfer is about. The usage of this is optional with a default value of Other. Some federates may be dependent on a value other than Other. There shall be a correspondence between the capability type and the set of attributes. Enumerated values: `Total` = Intersection of published attributes of the object class at the acquiring and divesting federate, `Movement` = e.g. Spatial, PowerPlantOn, etc., `Damage` = e.g. DamageState, Immobilized, etc., `Resource Consumption`, `Other`.|
|InstanceAttributeValues|Optional parameter, default value is an empty array. Shall be used when acquiring federate is unaware of current instance attribute values, e.g. re-entering federates.|



#### TMR_OfferTransferModellingResponsibility
An `TMR_OfferTransferModellingResponsibility` is sent from the responding federate to the requesting federate. If a transfer is initiated from an external source trigger federate, the requesting federate will also send a `TMR_OfferTransferModellingResponsibility` to the trigger federate as a response to a `TMR_InitateTransferModellingResponsibility` interaction as a confirmation of the trigger. 

**Special Case**:
When the transfer type is Divesting, the delivery order of the interaction `TMR_OfferTransferModellingResponsibility` and the HLA ownership callback service `requestAttributeOwnershipRelease` at the receiving federate is not determined. Due to this, receiving a `requestAttributeOwnershipRelease` callback should be treated in the same way as receiving a `TMR_OfferTransferModellingResponsibility` with a positive offer. The user-supplied tag in the callback contains the `TransactionID` which identifies a specific transfer process.

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|isOffering|True if and only if for all instances all attributes in the request are offered. False if for any instance any attribute in the request is not offered.|
|Respondent|Shall specify the sender of the offer interaction using the Federate Name.|
|Reason|Optional. An enumerated value that shall specify the reason for a negative offer: `Other`, `CapabilityDoesNotMatch`, `AttributeSetTooRestricted`, `AttributeSetTooExtensive`, `FederateTooBusy`, `AttributeSetNotCompatibleWithPublication`, `OwnershipStateNotApplicableWithRequest`, `EntityNotKnown`. Default value = `Other`.  |

#### TMR_InitiateTransferModellingResponsibility

A `TMR_InitiateTransferModellingResponsibility` is sent by a triggering federate to initiate a TMR request. 

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|Initiating|The Initiating parameter shall specify the originator of the interaction, e.g. the value may be the federate name or the Callsign for the role possessor.

All other parameters are equivalent to those in `TMR_RequestTransferModellingResponsibility` with the same definition as described above. These parameters should be copied and used by the requesting federate in a subsequent `TMR_RequestTransferModellingResponsibility` interaction.

#### TMR_CancelRequest
A `TMR_CancelRequest` is sent by the Requesting Federate to cancel a request.

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|Reason|An enumerated value that describes the reason for the cancellation: `Other` = When a Requesting Federate for some reason except time out decides not to complete a transfer. `TimeOut` =	When a model's time limit for receiving a TMR offer has passed.|

#### TMR_TransferResult
A `TMR_TransferResult` is sent by a Requesting Federate to a federate that initiated the TMR by sending a `TMR_InitiateTransferModellingResponsibility`.

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|TransferOk|A Boolean value indicating the result of the transfer. TRUE = Transfer Successful.|

### HLA Ownership Management Services

The HLA Ownership Management services used in TMR (callbacks marked with †) are:

* Attribute Ownership Acquisition (when negotiation)
* Attribute Ownership Acquisition If Available (without negotiation)
* Attribute Ownership Divesture If Wanted
* Cancel Attribute Ownership Acquisition
* Request Attribute Ownership Release †
* Attribute Ownership Acquisition Notification †
* Confirm Attribute Ownership Acquisition Cancellation †
* Attribute OwnershipUnavailable †

**Figure: Basic TMR Pattern**

1. To trigger a TMR request, a `TMR_InitiateTransferOfModellingResponsibility` can be sent from a triggering federate to a federate intended to issue a TMR request. Included in the parameters are the type of the transfer, and detail regarding attributes involved in the transfer. This step is optional.
2. If initiated by a trigger, the request federate sends a `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` to the triggering federate to indicate if the transfer request can be issued or not. 
3. A federate requesting a transfer of modelling responsibility sends a `TMR_RequestTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction. Included in the parameters are a type of the transfer, and detail regarding attributes involved in the transfer. Three types of transfer can be requested `Acquire`, `Divest` or `AcquireWithoutNegotiating`. The requesting federate specifies the transfer type in the `TransferType` parameter.
4. A federate responding to the request makes an offer by sending a `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction. Based on the offer the requesting federate can choose to start the transfer using HLA Ownership service.
    - Before divesting instance attributes, the attributes shall be updated (HLA service Update Attribute Values).
    After the acquisition of instance attributes, the attributes shall be updated (HLA service Update Attribute Values).
    - A Transaction ID is encoded and used as the User Supplied Tag in the HLA Ownership services.
5. If initiated by a trigger, the result of the transfer is sent using a `TMR_TransferResults` to the triggering federate.


## Use Cases
Some different cases are described with sequence diagrams.

### Negotiated acquisition
 

The requesting federate initiates the transfer to acquire instance attributes. The transfer is completed successfully.

**Figure: Negotiated Acquisition**

1. The Request federate sends a `TMR_RequestTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction to the Response federate. The `TransferType` parameter is set to `Acquire` to indicate that attribute ownership is requested to change from the Response federate to the Request federate. Included in the request are references to all instances and associated attributes involved in the transfer.
2. The Response federate replies to the request by sending a  `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction. If the `isOffering` parameter is True, the Response federate is offering to release ownership of the attributes.
3. The Request federate starts the attribute ownership transfer using HLA Ownership Services by calling the RTI service `attributeOwnershipAcquisition`.
4. The Response federate receives a `requestAttributeOwnershipRelease` callback from the RTI.
5. Before releasing attribute ownership, the Response federate sends a final `updateAttributeValues` for all attributes involved in the transfer.
6. The attribute update is reflected to the Request federate by the RTI using the `reflectAttributeValues` callback.
7. The Response federate divest its ownership of the attributes by calling the RTI service `attributeOwnershipDivestitureIfWanted`.
8. The RTI informs the Request federate (and the Response federate) of the changed ownership using the `attributeOwnershipAcquisitionNotiication` callback.


### Negotiated Divestiture 
The requesting federate initiates the transfer for divesting instance attributes.

end

**Figure: Negotiated Divestiture**

1. The Request federate sends a `TMR_RequestTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction to the Response federate. The `TransferType` parameter is set to `Divest` to indicate that attribute ownership is intended to change from the Request federate to the Response federate. Included in the request are references to all instances and associated attributes involved in the transfer.
2. The Response federate replies to the request by sending a  `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction. If the `isOffering` parameter is True, the Response federate is offering to acquire ownership of the attributes.
3. The Response federate starts the attribute ownership transfer using HLA Ownership Services by calling the RTI service `attributeOwnershipAcquisition`.
4. The Request federate receives a `requestAttributeOwnershipRelease` callback from the RTI.
5. Before releasing attribute ownership, the Request federate sends a final `updateAttributeValues` for all attributes involved in the transfer.
6. The attribute update is reflected to the Response federate by the RTI using the `reflectAttributeValues` callback.
7. The Request federate divest its ownership of the attributes by calling the RTI service `attributeOwnershipDivestitureIfWanted`.
8. The RTI informs the Response federate (and the Request federate) of the changed ownership using the `attributeOwnershipAcquisitionNotiication` callback.

In the above example, the HLA callback `requestAttributeOwnershipRelease`, with a TransactionId as UserSuppliedTag, may be delivered to the Requesting federate before the `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` is received. In such circumstances, the `requestAttributeOwnershipRelease` is considered a positive offer and the requesting federate shall ignore any `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` received later for the same TransactionId.

**Figure: Acquisition without Negotiation**


1. A `TMR_InitiateTransferOfModellingResponsibility` with `TransferType` set to `AcquireWithoutNegotiation` is sent from an trigger federate to the requesting federate.
2. A  `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` is send from the Requesting federate to the trigger federate as an indication that the initiation was received and if it is accepted.
3. The Requesting federate uses the HLA Ownership Management Service `attributeOwnershipAcquisitionIfAvailable` to request ownership of attributes without negotiation of its release. 
4. The HLA Ownership Management Service `attributeOwnershipAcquisitionNotification` informs the Request federate when transfer of ownership is completed.
5. The Request federate informs the Trigger federate of the result of the transfer by sending a `TMR_TransferResults` interaction.

#### A. Cancel Acquisition Request

1. The Request federate initiates an acquisition transfer with a `TMR_RequestTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction.
2. The Respons federate provides a positive offer by sending a `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction.
3. The Request federate sends a `TMR_CancelRequest` interaction to cancel the request either after or before receiving the positive offer. No `attributeOwnershipAcquisition` will be sent by the Request federate.

#### B. Cancel Divestiture Request

4. The Request federate initiates a divestiture transfer with a `TMR_RequestTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction.
5. The Respons federate provides a positive offer by sending a `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction.
6. The Respons federate immediately sends a `attributeOwnershipAcquisition`
7. The Request federate will receive the `TMR_OfferTransferOfModellingResponsibility` interaction and `requestAttributeOwnershipRelease` callback in an undetermined order.
8. The Request federate sends a `TMR_CancelRequest` interaction to cancel the request. The cancel is sent any time after making the request but before responding to the `requestAttributeOwnershipRelease` callback.
9. The Response federate calls `cancelAttributeOwnershipAcquisition` to abort the ongoing HLA attribute ownership transfer.
10. The Response federate is notified with a `confirmAttributeOwnershipCancellation` callback when the HLA attribute ownership transfer has been aborted.
